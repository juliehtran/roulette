# Roulette

This project is a Casino Roulette game that allows new user to place bets on a randomized system. You don't need to sign up, just start playing and take your chances with the cash you have. The wins, losses, and money are recorded through the server to the database. When an admin logs in, they are able to see the games played and how much funds the Casino lost. This reflects the money the user won too.
